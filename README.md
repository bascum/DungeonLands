This file is a simple random weaopn generator inspired by borderlands.

I made this for a semester project in my C++ class and hope to expand on this in the future and maybe even get some people to help contribute. As of right now I am new to Github and publishing any code. The code has limited funtionality and so far will only generate a weapon with a single trait. I hope to expand to different traits, weapon parts, materials, and possibly more.
